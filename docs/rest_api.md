# REST API

Aggregator service provides information about its REST API schema via endpoint
`api/v1/openapi.json`.
OpenAPI 3.0 is used to describe the schema; it can be read by human and consumed
by computers.

For example, if aggregator is started locally, it is possible to read schema
based on OpenAPI 3.0 specification by using the following command:

```shell
curl localhost:8080/api/v1/openapi.json
```

Please note that OpenAPI schema is accessible w/o the need to provide
authorization tokens.
