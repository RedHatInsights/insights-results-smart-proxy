# Continuous integration

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) is configured for this repository. Several
tests and checks are started for all pull requests:

* Unit tests that use the standard tool `go test` (see [Testing](testing.html)
  section).
* `go fmt` tool to check code formatting. That tool is run with `-s` flag to
perform [following
transformations](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/#hdr-The_simplify_command).
* `go vet` to report likely mistakes in source code, for example suspicious
constructs, such as `Printf` calls whose arguments do not align with the format
string
* `golint` as a linter for all Go sources stored in this repository
* `gocyclo` to report all functions and methods with too high cyclomatic
complexity. The cyclomatic complexity of a function is calculated according to
the following rules: 1 is the base complexity of a function +1 for each `if`,
`for`, `case`, `&&` or `||` Go Report Card warns on functions with cyclomatic
complexity > 9
* `goconst` to find repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant
* `gosec` to inspect source code for security problems by scanning the Go AST
* `ineffassign` to detect and print all ineffectual assignments in Go code
* `abcgo` to measure ABC metrics for Go source code and check if the metrics
  does not exceed specified threshold
* `errcheck` for checking for all unchecked errors in go programs

All the above test and checks should be executed without a single error in order
to merge new changes into `master` branch.
