Smart proxy for insights results

## Description

Insights Results Smart Proxy is a service that acts as a proxy between the different external
data pipeline clients and the different services providing the required information.

It provides access to the [Insights Results Aggregator](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-results-aggregator)
and to the [Insights Content Service](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-content-service),
providing the clients with different endpoints for accesing both report results and rule content metadata
from a single service.

## Architecture

## Results Smart Proxy in the external data pipeline

TODO

## Configuration

The configuration of the service is done by toml config, default one is `config.toml` in working directory,
but it can be overwritten by `INSIGHTS_RESULTS_SMART_PROXY_CONFIG_FILE` env var.

Also each key in config can be overwritten by corresponding env var. For example if you have config

```toml
[server]
address = ":8080"
auth = false
```

and environment variables

```shell
INSIGHTS_RESULTS_SMART_PROXY__SERVER__ADDRESS=":443"
INSIGHTS_RESULTS_SMART_PROXY__SERVER__AUTH="true"
```

the actual server will listen in port 443 instead of 8080 and it will be TLS enabled

### Server configuration

Server configuration is in section `[server]` in config file

```toml
[server]
address = ":8080"
api_prefix = "/api/v1/"
api_spec_file = "openapi.json"
debug = true
auth = true
auth_type = "xrh"
use_https = true
enable_cors = true
```

* `address` is host and port which server should listen to
* `api_prefix` is prefix for RestAPI path
* `api_spec_file` is the location of a required OpenAPI specifications file
* `debug` is developer mode that enables some special API endpoints not used on production. In
production, `false` is used every time.
* `auth` turns on or turns authentication. Please note that this option can be set to `false` only
in devel environment. In production, `true` is used every time.
* `auth_type` set type of auth, it means which header to use for auth `x-rh-identity` or
`Authorization`. Can be used only with `auth = true`. Possible options: `jwt`, `xrh`
* `use_https` is option to turn on TLS server. Please note that this option can be set to `false`
only in devel environment. In production, `true` is used every time.
* `enable_cors` is option to turn on CORS header, that allows to connect from different hosts
(**don't use it in production**)

Please note that if `auth` configuration option is turned off, not all REST API endpoints will be
usable. Whole REST API schema is satisfied only for `auth = true`.

### Services configuration

Services configuration is in section `[services]` in config file

```toml
[services]
aggregator = "http://aggregator.service:8080/api/v1
content = "http://content.service:8080/api/v1"
groups_poll_time = 60
```

* `aggregator` is the base endpoint URL for the Aggregator service where the Smart Proxy will connect and
retrieve the requested reports.
* `content` is the base endpoint URL for the Content service. Smart Proxy will retrieve and cache the
remmediations static content and the configured groups from its endpoints.
* `group_poll_time` is the time between groups configuration updates. It will be interpreted as the Golang
[`time.ParseDuration`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) function.

### Metrics configuration

Metrics configuration is in section `[metrics]` in config file

```toml
[metrics]
namespace = "mynamespace"
```

* `namespace` if defined, it is used as `Namespace` argument when creating all
  the Prometheus metrics exposed by this service.

## REST API schema based on OpenAPI 3.0

TODO

## Prometheus API

It is possible to use `/api/v1/metrics` REST API endpoint to read all metrics exposed to Prometheus
or to any tool that is compatible with it.
Currently, the following metrics are exposed:

### API related metrics

There are a set of metrics provieded by `insights-operator-utils` library, all
of them related with the API usage. These are the API metrics exposed:

1. `api_endpoints_requests` the total number of requests per endpoint
1. `api_endpoints_response_time` API endpoints response time
1. `api_endpoints_status_codes` a counter of the HTTP status code responses
   returned back by the service

Additionally it is possible to consume all metrics provided by Go runtime. There metrics start with
`go_` and `process_` prefixes.

### Metrics namespace

As explained in the [configuration](./configuration) section of this
documentation, a namespace can be provided in order to act as a prefix to the
metric name. If no namespace is provided in the configuration, the metrics will
be exposed as described in this documentation.
